# Java Boiler plate code

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

```java
public class Main {}
//each file can have one top level class and the name must match the file name
```

```java 
public static void main(String[] args) {}
//main method
// public - This is an access modifier that allows this method to be accessible from anywhere outside the class, which is necessary because it needs to be invoked by the Java runtime system when the program starts.

// static - This means that the method belongs to the class, rather than an instance of the class. This is important because the Java runtime needs to be able to call this method without having to instantiate the class.

// void - This is the return type of the method, indicating that it does not return any value.

// main - the name of the method special name recognized by java as the starting point

//String[] args - this allows the method to take in arguments. 

```
